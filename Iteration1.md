**Novice Users of the Software:**

As a novice user of the software, I want the menu to be self explanatory and easy to use so that I don’t get confused before I begin learning.

- When the app is opened for the first time and the user selects start, 3-4 pages (1-2 sentences & 1 visual per page) of introduction will be shown to show the basic rules of the game. After this, the menu of game play options will pop up with a tutorial style of instructions to choose the options one by one.

As a novice user of the software, I wish to become familiar with the game logic using display of hints and by watching guided game manuals (tutorials).

- When the first game starts, it will have rows/columns/blocks that are only missing one word and the game will prompt the user to fill in one of those first by the blank spot glowing/blinking. The tutorial will first feature the traditional digit values of sudoku to illustrate the game of sudoku itself, then transition to using words and their translations to illustrate how to play this modified version of sudoku. There will also be specialized tutorials whenever a user wants to try playing any variant modes that may have different rules or mechanics included.

As a novice user of the software, I want to have access to a keyboard that includes special letters/symbols in the learning language so that I can properly respond in those languages should my built-in keyboard only support the English alphabet.

- When in the game, there will be a button with a letter with an accent on it. Pressing the accent button will bring up a small menu including only the accent characters for easy input. The game tutorial will also explain how to input accented characters using the user’s keyboard, but the menu will serve as an ease of use function for those who are less tech savvy.

**Expert Users of the Software:**

As an expert user of the software, I want lots of options and settings so I can customize my experience exactly how I want.

- In the main menu, there will be a button for settings. These settings will include, graphical options (cosmetic/customizable) e.g. Light/Dark mode for user display, sound options, custom word input, and accessibility.

**Language Learners (3 levels):**

**Beginner Language Learners:**

As a beginner language learner, I want a mode that focuses on basic verb conjugation (I, you, he, she, etc.) so that I can properly speak and converse with others to further improve my language skills.

- In a mode intended for beginner learners, users will be asked to provide conjugations for 9 different random regular verbs in such a way that follows game rules. In order for the user to know what conjugation to use, context will be given. For example.”yo com\_\_” . Where the user will have to fill in with the appropriate conjugation in the correct cell. For this specific example, the answer is, “yo como” (“I eat”)

As a beginner language learner, I want to have lots of different easy categories of words so that I can expand my vocabulary before moving on to advanced concepts.

- When a user chooses to start a game, a menu will pop up, one of the options will be to choose a difficulty mode, another will be “word bank”. After selecting word bank, several categories of words can be chosen to add to the word bank, the user can select one or more. If no change is made to the word bank option, it will default to a bank of numbers 1 to 9 (similar to normal sudoku). Within each category, the words will have a difficulty level (beginner, intermediate, and expert) associated with it. The difficulty mode and word bank options combined will decide the possible words to appear in the game.

As a beginner language learner, I want the app to check if my answer is correct when I input them so that I don’t have wrong answers on my board that will affect me all throughout the game later.

- There will be multiple levels of hints offered on a sidebar in the game. One will be a hint that reveals the correct value for a given selected square (if no square is currently selected or the selected square is a given value, a random unfilled square will instead be revealed. If there are no available squares to fill in, the hint will do nothing), another will simply check if a single value the user has selected is correct, and a third will check the entire board and verify that all the current values are correct.

**Intermediate Language Learners:**

As an intermediate language learner, I want to know what my weak points are so I can work on them exclusively.

- Each time a wrong word is chosen, the word pair is saved to a category called “weak points” in the word bank. After there are enough words in this category, the player can choose to play this category to practice.
- When a game is played using the category “weak points”, if a word is played without error, at the end of the game, this word will be removed from the category “weak points”.

As an intermediate language learner, I want modes featuring conjugations in more advanced tenses such as future tense and preterite tense.

- Before the user starts a game they will be prompted to choose a difficulty. The intermediate difficulty will allow users to choose a category for verbs in future tense, preterite tense, or mixed including regular verbs.

**Expert Language Learners:**

As an expert language learner, I want a timed mode so that I can improve my translation speed and compete against myself.

- While the user is playing the game, there will be a timer in the corner that begins when the game begins. This timer will have digits for hours, minutes, and seconds for flexibility. After the game is solved, the player will be asked if they want to include their time on the ‘leaderboard’ (local) and if so will be prompted to enter a name to pair with their time. The leaderboard can be accessed in game via menu.

As an expert language learner, I want modes featuring conjugations for more advanced verbs in tenses such as future tense and preterite tense.

- Before the user starts a game they will be prompted to choose a difficulty. The expert difficulty will allow users to choose a category for irregular and regular verbs in future tense, preterite tense, or mixed including regular verbs and irregular verbs

As an expert language learner, I want the option to type in my answer instead of picking from the options to test my spelling and accent usage.

- When a user chooses to start a game, a menu will pop up, one of the options will be whether or not the user wants to type their answers directly. When this mode is selected, the game board will be different from the regular mode. In standard mode, Instead of having the 9 words from the other language displayed and interactable to be chosen

from, the 9 English words will be displayed but will not be able to be selected directly as an answer, and instead will serve as a guide to show which words are in the puzzle and the user will need to type in the translated word themselves (including proper spelling and accent usage)

**Language Teachers:**

As a language teacher, I want the program to be appealing to look at for my students so that they will feel more encouraged to practice their language.

- When a user selects menu -> display options -> color schemes, there will be several preset color schemes to choose from. When a color scheme is selected, the display (both the menu and the game board) will be changed to it. The display options menu will also give the user the option to change font, and background images.

As a language teacher, I want the ability to add my own words to the puzzles, so that I can make new puzzles to help with each new lesson I teach.

- Accessible through the menu, the word bank is customizable. The user can create new categories and add new word pairs to categories (both preset and user created). Any user added categories or words can also be deleted if needed, but the given categories and words cannot be deleted. To add a category, only a name needs to be provided. To add a word pair, two fields need to be filled with the English word and the translation, and a difficulty level needs to be selected for the word.

As a language teacher, I want to be able to view statistics on my students' progress to understand what students struggle with.

- A button in the main menu will allow users to view stats regarding their previous games. These stats include: average # of mistakes made, average time taken to solve the puzzle, best and worst time, average hints used, etc.

As a language teacher, I want the app to display info about how the player did after each game (accuracy, time, hints used) so that my students can track if they have been improving.

- After each game, a short summary will appear including: time taken to solve, mistakes made, hints used, etc.

As a language teacher, I want students to be able to use the application on a wide variety of devices/operating systems to ensure that as little students are held back due to incompatible devices.

- When installing the app, users should have as few blocks as possible. Users should be notified if their device is incompatible.
